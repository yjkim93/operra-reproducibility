This is a fork of the Computational Reproducibility Workshop Repository by Youngjun Kim.

Part of the [OPeR-RA workshop series](https://www.swissrn.org/contents/activities/operra/).

As part of this workshop you will fork this repository and turn it into a small
but complete reproducible project: a dynamic report generated from real data, an
analysis pipeline you run end to end, the container it all runs inside, and a
published archive with its own DOI.

**No prior experience with Git, Docker, Snakemake or Nextflow is expected.** Having seen some R or Python before helps in Module 2, but the exercises are written to be followed without it. The workshop environment runs in your browser, so there is nothing to install.

The website for this workshop is: <https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/>

## Modules

0. [**Introduction**](https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/module_0_introduction/slides/): What computational reproducibility is and why it matters
1. [**Version Control**](https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/module_1_version_control/slides/): Git and version control
2. [**Dynamic Reporting**](https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/module_2_dynamic_reporting/slides/): Writing reports where code and prose live together
3. [**Workflow Management**](https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/module_3_workflow_management/slides/): Chaining analysis steps into a reproducible pipeline
4. [**Software Containers**](https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/module_4_containers/slides/): Docker and containerising an analysis
5. [**Sharing & Publishing**](https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/module_5_sharing_publishing/slides/): Archiving, licensing and publishing reproducible work

Each module pairs a short presentation with a hands-on exercise. Start with the
[Instructions](https://a1eksb.github.io/operra-reproducibility/instructions/)
page to set up your environment before the workshop begins.

## Getting Started

<details open>
<summary><strong>Option 1: Open in GitHub Codespaces</strong> (recommended)</summary>

<br>

- Fork this repository to your account: <https://github.com/a1eksb/operra-reproducibility>

- Create a new codespace.
  1. Code (green button) > Codespaces
  2. Create codespace (this may take several minutes)

    ![Creating a codespace: open Code → Codespaces → Codespace repository configuration, set Dev container configuration to "Operra - RStudio (project-wide)", then Create codespace](contents/assets/creating-codespaces.gif)

- You will be notified in the bottom-right corner that this workspace has tasks defined that can launch processes automatically. Click **Allow** to open the RStudio instance in a new tab.
- Alternatively navigate to `Ports` and open the provided URL in a new tab

- When you are finished, stop or delete the codespace so it does not keep consuming your free monthly quota.
  1. Open `Code` → `Codespaces`
  2. Use the `...` menu next to your codespace:
  3. **Stop** keeps your work for later, while
  4. **Delete** removes the codespace and any uncommitted changes in it.

<summary><strong>Option 2: Running Locally via Docker</strong></summary>

<br>

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

#### Option A: Docker Compose (recommended)

Clone the repository, then build the image locally and mount the project directory:

```bash
docker compose build pyverse --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

Open RStudio Server at [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) (no login required).

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

#### Option B: Build and run manually

Build the image locally:

```bash
docker build -t pyverse .
```

Run with the project directory mounted:

```bash
docker run --rm -d \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 \
  -e DISABLE_AUTH=true \
  -e USER=rstudio \
  -v "$(pwd)":/home/rstudio/project \
  pyverse
```

Open RStudio Server at [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) (no login required).

> **Note:** RStudio is bound to `127.0.0.1` only, so it is not accessible from other machines on your network.

## Rendering the site

Pushing to `main` renders `contents/` with Quarto and publishes the result to GitHub
Pages. Forks require some setup before their first deployment:

1. Open the fork's **Actions** tab and enable workflows.
2. Under **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main`, or run the *Quarto Website* workflow manually from the **Actions** tab.

The fork's site will appear at
`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/operra-reproducibility/` after the deployment completes.

The render runs inside the prebuilt workshop image
`ghcr.io/a1eksb/operra-reproducibility:rstudio`, which is public, so a fork builds nothing
for ordinary site changes. Once Actions and Pages are configured, the first deployment
can use this image directly. Your `contents/` changes are always picked up:
the image only supplies the environment, while the site is rendered from the checked-out repository.

Changes to [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) or [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) are the one exception, since those define the image rather than the content. To render against your own build, push a change to either file so the *RStudio (pyverse) Image* workflow publishes an image under your account, then point the `image:` line in
[`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) at it:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/YOUR-USERNAME/operra-reproducibility:rstudio
```

Newly published packages are private by default. Either make yours public in your account's package settings, or add `packages: read` to that job's `permissions:` block.

## Repository structure

`contents/` holds both halves of the workshop: the slides, and the hands-on
material. Everything outside `contents/` exists to give
you an environment those examples run in, or to publish the site.
